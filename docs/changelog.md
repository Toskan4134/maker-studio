# Changelog

User-facing changes to the Maker Studio app and its game-side plugin.

## v1.1.1

Small update: a faster way to open projects, plus editor and in-game preview performance fixes.

### Additions
- 📂 **Open a project by double-clicking it** — create a `.makerstudio` file for your project (**File → Create Project File…**) and double-click it in your file manager to launch Maker Studio straight into that project, just like RPG Maker XP's project file. (On the Linux AppImage, register it once with **Help → Install Linux File Association…**.)

### Fixes
- ⚡ **Editor performance** — the map canvas no longer lags when painting lots of tiles, tiles with color or rotation properties, or autotiles, or when working on very large maps.
- 🗺️ **Faster in-game map previews** — the debug "jump to map" and map-connection editor screens no longer freeze on maps with many styled tiles.

## v1.1.0

Update focused on stability: several in-game and editor bugs fixed, plus broader engine support.

### Additions
- 🍷 **Play/test on macOS** — the editor's "Run Game" button now launches your game through Wine on macOS (needs Wine, or Game Porting Toolkit/Whisky on Apple Silicon).
- 🧩 **Two more supported engines** — vanilla Pokémon Essentials v19.1 and v20.1 now have their own Integration to install.

### Fixes
- 🐢 **Big performance fix** — maps with lots of autotiles or extended-layer content used to run at single-digit FPS in-game; they now run at full speed regardless of map size.
- 🧱 Fixed several in-game collision bugs: tiles that should block movement could sometimes be walked through, and object hitboxes could land one tile off.
- 🎨 Fixed autotile passage/priority/terrain properties sometimes saving the wrong values to the wrong tileset, which could make a shared autotile graphic (e.g. sand, water) behave inconsistently across maps.
- 🖼️ Fixed a crash when placing tiles from another tileset onto very tall tilesets.
- 🌑 Fixed shadows occasionally drawing in front of or behind the wrong tiles.
- 👣 Fixed footprints (La Base de Sky 1.2.1) not appearing on sand painted with Maker Studio's autotiles or extended layers.
- 🔍 Fixed map search not finding maps nested several folders deep.
- 🖌️ Fixed autotile previews sometimes going blank after switching projects.
- 📐 Fixed map resize not saving events' new positions in-game.
- 💡 Fixed lighting/color effects looking different in the Game Simulator than in the actual game.
- 🧩 Fixed mods being unable to read or edit an event's list of commands.

### Changes
- 📝 The event editor now shows each line of a multi-line Show Text, Comment or Script command as its own row, matching the classic editor's look — while still selecting, moving and deleting as one command.
- 🪟 The event editor window no longer resizes itself when switching between pages.

## v1.0.0

First public release. See the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/Toskan4134/maker-studio/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for details.
