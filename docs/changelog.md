# Changelog

User-facing changes to the Maker Studio app and its game-side plugin.

## v1.2.0

Update focused on the game-side plugin: the editor now keeps it up to date for you, plus a reusable script library and a long-standing rendering fix.

### Additions
- 🔌 **The editor keeps your Integration up to date** — open a project and Maker Studio checks the plugin installed in your game. If it's older than the editor, it offers to download and install the right one for you (**Update Now**), point you at the download page, or remind you later. It works out which Integration your project uses on its own, keeps your project's mods and settings untouched, and handles the paste-in builds (BES v5, v17.1) by replacing just their script. You can run the check any time from **Help → Check Game Integration…**.
- ✂️ **Script snippets** — every script box in the event editor now has a **Snippets…** button: save the bits of code you retype, then drop them in with one click. One shared library across your whole project, with rename, overwrite, delete, and import/export to a file.
- 🧩 **One more supported engine** — vanilla Pokémon Essentials v17.1 now has its own Integration to install.

### Fixes
- 🧱 **Fixed tiles flickering in-game while walking** — a tile stacked on two extended layers could show one layer or the other depending on where you were standing, so parts of a map appeared and disappeared as you moved.
- 💾 Fixed Ctrl+S not saving while the Scripts window was open.

## v1.1.1

Small update: a faster way to open projects, plus editor and in-game preview performance fixes.

### Additions
- 📂 **Open a project by double-clicking it** — create a `.makerstudio` file for your project (**File → Create Project File…**) and double-click it in your file manager to launch Maker Studio straight into that project, just like RPG Maker XP's project file. (On the Linux AppImage, register it once with **Help → Install Linux File Association…**.)

### Fixes
- ⚡ **Editor performance** — the map canvas no longer lags when painting lots of tiles, tiles with color or rotation properties, or autotiles, or when working on very large maps.
- 🗺️ **Faster in-game map previews** — the debug "jump to map" and map-connection editor screens no longer freeze on maps with many styled tiles.

## v1.1.0

Update focused on stability: several in-game and editor bugs fixed, plus broader engine support.

### Additions
- 🍷 **Play/test on macOS** — the editor's "Run Game" button now launches your game through Wine on macOS (needs Wine, or Game Porting Toolkit/Whisky on Apple Silicon).
- 🧩 **Two more supported engines** — vanilla Pokémon Essentials v19.1 and v20.1 now have their own Integration to install.

### Fixes
- 🐢 **Big performance fix** — maps with lots of autotiles or extended-layer content used to run at single-digit FPS in-game; they now run at full speed regardless of map size.
- 🧱 Fixed several in-game collision bugs: tiles that should block movement could sometimes be walked through, and object hitboxes could land one tile off.
- 🎨 Fixed autotile passage/priority/terrain properties sometimes saving the wrong values to the wrong tileset, which could make a shared autotile graphic (e.g. sand, water) behave inconsistently across maps.
- 🖼️ Fixed a crash when placing tiles from another tileset onto very tall tilesets.
- 🌑 Fixed shadows occasionally drawing in front of or behind the wrong tiles.
- 👣 Fixed footprints (La Base de Sky 1.2.1) not appearing on sand painted with Maker Studio's autotiles or extended layers.
- 🔍 Fixed map search not finding maps nested several folders deep.
- 🖌️ Fixed autotile previews sometimes going blank after switching projects.
- 📐 Fixed map resize not saving events' new positions in-game.
- 💡 Fixed lighting/color effects looking different in the Game Simulator than in the actual game.
- 🧩 Fixed mods being unable to read or edit an event's list of commands.

### Changes
- 📝 The event editor now shows each line of a multi-line Show Text, Comment or Script command as its own row, matching the classic editor's look — while still selecting, moving and deleting as one command.
- 🪟 The event editor window no longer resizes itself when switching between pages.
